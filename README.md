# ECSE 321 -Introduction to Software Engineering Project Group 20

<h3> Project Overview :books:</h3>

As a team of developer, we will be designing a website and app for a library.The system that we will develop will help support the library's users and allow them to 
browse for items, reserve items and borrow them for a specific period.

The system in question shall allow user's to take full advantage of the services of the library, by obtaining their library card ID from the librarian, with just their physical address. If they are in the same area as the library,
then the system shall allow outside users to be able to use the Library's services but only if they sign up, pay a fee and are verified by the head librarian.
Both have the optino to create an online account which will require a username/password and address.


The system shall also provide services to employees, in the from of librarian's being able to see their schedules and the head librarian being able to fire and hire librarians,assign them their schedules
and set opening hours/days of the library.
