# ECSE 321 -Introduction to Software Engineering Project Group 20

<h3> Project Overview :books:</h3>

The Library System,that we will develop,provides free access to books, movies, archives, newspapers and music albums to users of a small town. The System allows users to browse available titles, reserve them, and then pick them up at the library afterwards. The users must create an account through the website or the application and then must be verified by the Head Librarian. In return, they will be issued a library card. Since the library mainly provides resources to the local of the small town, users who live outside of the small town must pay a small fee to use the library's services. The Head Librarian has the privilege to hire and fire Librarians, assign shifts to them and setup the library's opening and closing hours.<br/><br/>

The website and application is accessed by two types of users: the employees which include the Librarians and the Head Librarian, and the local citizens.
